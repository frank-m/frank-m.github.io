# Three Healthy Dinner Recipes for Two

## Meal 1: Creamy Lemon Orzo with Roasted Pointed Peppers

### Ingredients
- 190g orzo pasta
- 1-2 pointed peppers
- 1-2 lemons (zest and juice)
- 150g pasta cheese (grated)
- 250g cherry tomatoes, halved
- 100g fresh spinach or arugula
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 500ml vegetable or chicken stock
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Optional: 300g chicken breast or 200g shrimp

### Instructions

1. **Prep the peppers:** Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Cut pointed peppers in half lengthwise, remove seeds, and slice into strips. Toss with 1 tbsp olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for 20-25 minutes until soft and slightly charred.

2. **Optional protein:** If using chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces, season with salt and pepper, and pan-fry in 1 tbsp olive oil until cooked through (about 6-8 minutes). Set aside. If using shrimp, cook for 2-3 minutes per side and set aside.

3. **Toast the orzo:** In a large pan or deep skillet, heat 1 tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Add orzo and toast for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, until lightly golden.

4. **Cook risotto-style:** Add minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add stock about 125ml at a time, stirring frequently and allowing the liquid to absorb before adding more (like making risotto). This takes about 15-18 minutes total.

5. **Add vegetables:** When orzo is nearly cooked (al dente), stir in cherry tomatoes and cook for 2 minutes until they start to soften.

6. **Make it creamy:** Remove from heat. Stir in the grated pasta cheese, lemon zest (from 1-2 lemons), and lemon juice (2-3 tbsp). The cheese will melt and create a creamy sauce. Add spinach/arugula and let it wilt from the heat.

7. **Finish:** Fold in roasted peppers and cooked protein if using. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add a splash of stock or pasta water if it's too thick.

8. **Serve:** Plate immediately, garnish with extra lemon zest and a drizzle of olive oil.

## Meal 2: Lemon Herb Chicken with Rice & Honey-Roasted Pointed Peppers

### Ingredients

**For the chicken:**
- 300-400g chicken breast or thighs
- 1 lemon (zest and juice)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp dried thyme (or 1 tbsp fresh)
- 1 tsp dried rosemary (or 1 tbsp fresh)
- Salt and black pepper

**For the rice:**
- 200g rice (basmati or jasmine)
- 400ml water or stock
- Pinch of salt

**For the peppers:**
- 1-2 pointed peppers
- 1 tbsp honey
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper

**For the vegetables:**
- 1 head broccoli, cut into florets
- 1 onion, sliced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper

### Instructions

1. **Marinate the chicken:** In a bowl, combine lemon zest, lemon juice, minced garlic, olive oil, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Add chicken and coat well. Marinate for at least 15 minutes (or up to 4 hours in the fridge).

2. **Start the rice:** Rinse rice until water runs clear. In a pot, bring water/stock to a boil, add rice and salt, reduce to low heat, cover, and simmer for 12-15 minutes until cooked. Remove from heat and let steam, covered, for 5 minutes.

3. **Roast the peppers:** Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Keep pointed peppers whole (just remove stems). Mix honey and olive oil, brush over peppers, season with salt and pepper. Place on a baking tray and roast for 20-25 minutes, turning halfway, until tender and caramelized.

4. **Cook the chicken:** Heat a large pan over medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and cook for 6-7 minutes per side for breasts (8-10 minutes per side for thighs) until golden and cooked through (internal temp 75°C/165°F). Pour remaining marinade over chicken in the last 2 minutes. Rest for 5 minutes, then slice.

5. **Prepare vegetables:** While chicken rests, in another pan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add sliced onion and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add broccoli florets, season with salt and pepper, and cook for 5-6 minutes until tender-crisp, adding a splash of water if needed.

6. **Serve:** Fluff rice with a fork. Plate rice, top with sliced chicken, arrange honey-roasted peppers and vegetables on the side. Drizzle any pan juices from the chicken over the dish.

## Meal 3: Asian-Style Shrimp with Noodles & Stir-Fried Pointed Peppers

### Ingredients

**For the shrimp:**
- 300g large shrimp/prawns, peeled and deveined
- 1 lemon (juice)
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp honey
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp fresh ginger, grated

- 1 tsp fresh ginger, grated
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- Optional: 2 spring onions, sliced
- Sesame seeds for garnish

### Instructions

1. **Marinate the shrimp:** In a bowl, mix lemon juice, soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Add shrimp, toss to coat, and let marinate for 10-15 minutes (no longer or the lemon will start to "cook" them).

2. **Cook the noodles:** Bring a pot of water to boil. Cook noodles according to package directions (usually 4-6 minutes for egg noodles, 8-10 for rice noodles). Drain, rinse with cold water, toss with sesame oil, and set aside.

3. **Cook the shrimp:** Heat a large pan or wok over high heat with 1 tbsp vegetable oil. Remove shrimp from marinade (reserve marinade) and pat dry. Add shrimp in a single layer and cook for 2 minutes without moving. Flip and cook another 1-2 minutes until pink and just cooked through. Remove to a plate.

4. **Make the stir-fry:** In the same pan (or a wok), heat vegetable oil over high heat. Add pointed pepper slices and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until slightly softened. Add garlic and ginger, cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.

5. **Add greens:** Add bok choy/cabbage and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until wilted but still crisp. Add soy sauce and the reserved salmon marinade. Toss to coat.

6. **Combine with noodles:** Add cooked noodles to the pan and toss everything together for 1-2 minutes until heated through and well combined. Return shrimp to the pan and toss gently to combine and heat through (about 30 seconds).

7. **Serve:** Divide noodles, vegetables, and shrimp between two plates. Garnish with sliced spring onions and sesame seeds. Add extra lemon wedges on the side if desired.
